## Project Objective
#### The goal of this project is to create a multi-sensor alarm system, which is capable of communicating with a computer using Enhanced Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (EUSART) protocol. The heart of the alarm is the PIC18F4520 microcontroller unit (MCU), which is manufactured by Microchip
